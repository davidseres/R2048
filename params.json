{"name":"R2048","tagline":"This is an R version of the 2048 game","body":"### R2048.\r\nI've programmed (a non-fancy version of) the famous 2048 game in R. \r\nThe original can be found [here](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). To start the game, just issue the following commands in an R session:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsource(\"R2048.R\")\r\nstart_2048()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will initialize the game in R. You will see the grid in a plot window. Upon the call the user will be prompted for input.\r\n\r\n### How to play\r\nUse the keys w (up), a (left), s (down) and d (right) followed by enter to move the tiles in the desired direction. The rules are to merge two identical numbers into one with the sum of the two merged numbers.\r\n\r\n### Remarks\r\nThis program was written using the 64-bit version of R 3.0.2.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\n2014, David Seres (@davidseres)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
